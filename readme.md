A really barebone command-line chess program written in rust. I'm making this while learning Rust on the way so bear with me through this clusterfuck of code lol
#### What can it do?
It can parse user input (src dst) form and determine if a move is valid or not. and switching between 2 player <br>
Play until someone's king is captured
#### What need to be done?
Ummmmm, a lot, apparently, special move (promotion, castling, en passant) <br>
Check and check-mate (the real winning condition) <br>
Using algebraic notation instead, ability to recreate a chess match from algebraic notation record <br>
